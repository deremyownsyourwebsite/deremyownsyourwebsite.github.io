    I'm a sophomore at Towers High School (class of 2025) and I don't really take any liking to sports. I feel as though I'm better at math compared to any other subjects I take
    Classes in. I can possibly see a positive future before me...I just have to get over my lack of motive over longer periods of time. I don't enjoy long and tedious
    work either, although I can complete the work the same way I complete shorter assignents

  My favorite music artist is playboicarti; I devote my life to carti, I even see him as a god at times (not literally). Playboicarti is better than any musical artist
  anyone could ever listen to, including Kendrick Lamar (he's the worst). Before you even speak any negative energy towards carti, I have CONCRETE proof that playboicarti is THE best rapper to ever
    be born into our world.
